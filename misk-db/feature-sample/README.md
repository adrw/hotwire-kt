# misk-db feature sample

This project serves as a sample service to show how one could use the misk-db-feature library to leverage DB backed misk.Feature flags.

The service in this example is named `flagpole`. It includes feature flagged business logic for an imaginary business that does recurring maintenance on different billboard locations.
